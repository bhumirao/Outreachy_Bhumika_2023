# Outreachy_Bhumika_2023


### As a resident of Chhattisgarh, India, I am passionate about contributing to the fight against climate change, which is a pressing global issue affecting communities worldwide. The neighboring state of Odisha has been impacted by the devastating effects of climate change, such as frequent cyclones and floods that harm both the environment and people's livelihoods.

### I am eager to take part in Moja Global's outreachy project because of their commitment to developing open-source software that supports ambitious climate action. Their innovative software can improve climate modeling accuracy, enhance monitoring systems, and assist policymakers, businesses, and communities in making informed decisions.

### By participating in this project, I hope to contribute to the creation of a more sustainable future for our planet. I am motivated to take responsibility for reducing my carbon footprint and supporting the adoption of sustainable practices, such as renewable energy and water conservation, to mitigate and adapt to climate change's effects. I believe that by working collaboratively, we can make a significant impact on the fight against climate change and create a better world for ourselves and future generations.
